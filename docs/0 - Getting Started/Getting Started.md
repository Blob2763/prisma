# Getting Started
1. [Download the repository](https://github.com/Blob2763/prisma/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the ZIP file onto your computer.  
2. Open the extracted folder. For the best experience, open it in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.  
   - In VS Code, open the files `main.py` and `code.prsm`.  
3. To run the code:  
   - **If using VS Code**: you can run the code by running `main.py` directly.
   - **If using another terminal**: navigate to the folder where `main.py` is located (if not already there), then run the command:  
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
4. If everything works, you should get `Prisma is working!` as the output.
5. To write your own code, just edit the `code.prsm` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must have Python installed for Prisma to work

> [!NOTE]  
> This is a very early prototype. In the future, there will be an easier way to run programs.
